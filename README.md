This is my interview assignment i was task to do the following. 

flight search (max 8 hours) 

Build an application to book a flight: a user can enter a departure and arrival location, the desired departure date and the number of people. After clicking on the search button you will get an overview with found flights. When the user selects a flight, the user can enter his data and the user gets an overview of the data. 
The focus is on the flight search, the data may be mocked (JSON), or come from an API. Of course it doesn't have to work completely. (For example, only a limited number of destinations.) 

The assignment must be made in one of the common front-end frameworks: React, Angular or Vue. 
There are no requirements with regard to the look & feel.
